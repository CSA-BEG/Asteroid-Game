# Asteroid-Game

Trey Grant

A simple game in which asteroids fly from the right hand side of the screen toward a spaceship on the left, shoot them for points.
White asteroids are worth 100 points, red are worth 1000.
Shooting an asteroid gives points, while missing an Asteroid takes 100 away.
Getting hit takes a life away, three lives to game over.

The game started as a Pong game that was repurposed, which can explain "paddle" and "ball" in the code. First I added shooting. Then the asteroids. Then proper collision. Death screen and High Scores. And finally the red asteroids and opening screen.
